summary: >
  Based on CY school of design's vision, our research focuses on the analysis and design of sustainable transitions, recognizing three major challenges for design practices: <br>1- the change in geographical scale, <br>2- the heterogeneity of actors and their interests, <br>3- and the introduction of long-term regeneration issues.

        <p>How can we  inform stakeholders about the current and evolving state of the systems in which they live, and on which they can rely (what is already in place, what works) or which they want to remedy (what needs to be changed)? The research focuses as much on system representations as on design methodologies. We analyze and design representations and visualizations of systems in their current state for heterogeneous audiences and a diversity of purposes: data visualization, information vizualizations, systemic design</p>

        <p>How ecological awareness can take hold and spread? The research focuses on identifying the "concerned" (Peneau, 2023), on the ways of capturing and maintaining their attention, and on what supports sustainable behaviors. </p><p>We need to dentify the new entrants, human and non-human (Favret-Saada, 1977), (Favret-saada, 2009), (Latour, 2017), and their roles in decision-making (Latour, 2018) (Karana et al., 2020) We investigate the issues of opinion leadership and influence with a focus on actors as well as media (Rogers &amp; Cartano, 1962), Roger 1983, Flynn, Goldsmith, 1996, Valente, Pumpuang, 2007); Akrich, M., M. Callon, and B. Latour. 2002) </p><p>We design and organize new format of engagement and feedback: nudge (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2009), (Ölander &amp; Thøgersen, 2014) positive reinforcement and gamification theory, engagement management (Andriof et al., 2017)....</p>

        <p>Elaborating on participatory design, how can we design for fruitful debates and decision making processes involving a heterogeneous range of "concerned" parties.</p><p>o how do we prepare for debates? stakeholder mapping (Reed et al., 2009), controversy mapping (Venturini, 2010), representativeness and governance formats (Berthet &amp; Hickey, 2018)</p><p>o how do we design debate modalities? design for debate, agonistic design (Gentes &amp; Mollon, 2015). (Bonaccorsi &amp; julliard, 2012)</p><p>o how do we ensure the material and human conditions for a fair debate? (Umney &amp; Lloyd, 2018), (Meadowcroft, 2009),(Gentes &amp; Perez, 2022)</p><p>o how do we finalize debates and move on to decisions: rethink negotiation and voting methods (e. g. quadratic voting, (Lalley &amp; Weyl, 2018)</p>
