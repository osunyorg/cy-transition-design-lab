<p>Anthony is an independent interface designer (senior UX/UI designer). In 2013, he co-founded <a href="https://collectifbam.fr/home.html" target="_blank">Collectif Bam</a>, a global design studio committed to societal transitions. Ten years later, the agency evolved into <a href="https://praticable.fr/" target="_blank">Praticable</a>, a cooperative focused on responsible digital design. Since early 2024, Anthony has been working independently on digital projects of public interest and teaching his profession at various schools and universities.</p>
