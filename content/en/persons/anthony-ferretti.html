<p>Anthony enjoys blending design, research, and entrepreneurship. His career is the result of his entrepreneurial projects, his reflections on his profession, his collaborations with research collectives such as Fing, Ouishare, or IRI, and, of course, his teaching at the Sorbonne with Pierre-Damien Huyghe and Annie Gentès. Anthony has worked with numerous organizations, including public entities like ANCT, ANACT, Banque de France, ADEME, the University of Lille, as well as associations like Démocratie Ouverte, Osinum, or Île-de-France Tiers-lieux, and cultural institutions like the Creil Theatre and La Gaîté Lyrique. In each of his collaborations, Anthony strives to design beautiful, simple, and useful interfaces.</p><p>For him, design is both a subject of study and a multidisciplinary profession aimed at enhancing the conviviality of objects. This is how he defines the interface: a mediation between humans and technology, a protean entity, digital or not, whose design must be perceptible and practical. His skills are diverse and organized into four domains: graphic design for identities, volumetric design for products, digital design for interactions, and strategic design for perspectives.</p><p>Finally, his experience naturally leads him to coach and advise designers and entrepreneurs, and to teach his profession at schools and universities, notably at Sciences Po, the Sorbonne, ECV, and Bordeaux Montaigne.<br></p>
