<p>This thesis aims to examine the design practices implemented in <a>organizational transition processes</a>. We aim to identify how these practices fit into complex systems. We assume that organizational transitions towards <a>sustainability</a> depend on their ability to visualize and archive the systems in which they are rooted and towards which they strive.</p><p>Using the design transition methodology, we use field projects to study how design tools can help employees of a big firm to transition towards a more sustainable system. <br><br></p>
