<p>Throughout her design studies, Delphine developed an interest towards systemic design. Her double degree in design and innovation mixes sustainable transition with design methodologies. </p><p>Today through the thesis, she studies the ways of helping big organizations transform themselves from within, using design tools and questioning how archives and day-to-day practices can participate in this transformation.</p>
