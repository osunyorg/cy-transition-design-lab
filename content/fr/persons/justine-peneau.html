        <p>Since november 2023, and for 2 years, Justine Peneau is working on the PEPR LINDDA project : Living Infrastructure to Design responsible Digital technology for Agroecological transition. In this contexte she contributes to elaborate and evaluate a conceptual and methodological framework for an “living” infrastructure design model for agroecological digital transition. She also participates to the analysis and co-design of a responsible digital model for agroecological transition, at the interface between humans, living beings, non-humans, and non-living entities. </p>

---
<p> Justine Peneau holds a Ph.D. in Design since January 2023. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher within the Design research group, as part of the PEPR LINDDA project : Living Infrastructure to Design responsible Digital technology for Agroecological transition. Her research explores the temporal dimension of design, particularly in the context of collaborative and/or participative design approaches. She examines time from an anthropological perspective, viewing it as a framework that simultaneously enables and constrains interactions, productions, know-how, tools, etc. Following a sociology of emergence, she also observes the dynamics at play in co-design situations.<br></p>
